# Pairs Trading Statistical Arbitrage System

This project is a quantitative trading system that implements a pairs trading (statistical arbitrage) strategy. It analyzes the spread between two correlated assets (such as stocks or cryptocurrencies), generates trading signals based on z-score thresholds, and visualizes the results with quant-style, visually dense graphs.

## What is this project about?
- **Pairs Trading**: A market-neutral trading strategy that exploits the mean-reverting behavior of the spread between two correlated assets.
- **Features**:
  - Synthetic or real data support
  - Spread and z-score calculation
  - Automated trading logic (long/short/exit)
  - Performance metrics (total return, Sharpe ratio, trade count)
  - Quantitative, dark-themed visualizations (spread, z-score, 3D scatter)
